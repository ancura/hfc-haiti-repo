					Please mark your calendars and plan to join us for a special night of
					celebration! Bring your friends and learn about the exciting initiatives
					and developments at our children's home, school and the larger
					community in which we serve.

					We're thrilled to be joined by Executive Chef, Jocelyn Aurelien, trained
					at the Culinary Institute of America, whose passion is expression of his
					Haitian heritage through recipes learned by cooking at his mother's side.
					Come experience a unique taste of Haiti and join us as we help orphaned
					and vulnerable children!
